# **App Name**: Echo Chamber Simulator

## Core Features:

- Interactive Feed Simulation: Simulate an interactive social media feed with customizable posts, comments, likes, and shares to mirror real-world platforms like Twitter.
- Engagement Simulation: Implement fully clickable likes, comments, and retweets to allow participants to engage with the simulated social media content.
- Stimuli Design Interface: Design an intuitive interface for researchers to create and modify posts and comments, controlling variables such as valence (sympathetic, condemning, neutral) and level of social support (high/low engagement).
- Interaction Tracking: Record and track participant interactions, including clicks, comments, time spent on posts, and scrolling behavior, to use as dependent or independent variables in the study. Data will be stored in Firebase.
- Replicability Documentation: Provide clear comments and documentation for all code and configurations to ensure replicability of the experiment setup and results.
- CSV Export: All participant interaction data can be stored and later retrieved via csv file for analysis.
- Advanced Experiment Control: One-click manipulation checks with realism, algorithmic nuance, and control over post order randomization.
- Participant Commenting: Allow participants to create their own comments and replies to both main posts and simulated replies to the main posts. These comments will be stored in the Firebase database.
- Post Focus and Time Tracking: Participants can click on a post and 'pull in' to focus on the post and its replies, tracking time spent on those pulled in posts, with user-friendly pulling in and out of the posts.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5), evoking trust and objectivity, crucial for simulating an unbiased platform.
- Background color: Light gray (#EEEEEE), providing a neutral backdrop that minimizes distraction.
- Accent color: Soft purple (#9575CD), used for interactive elements to draw attention without overwhelming the user.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, offering a neutral, modern, and readable style.
- Use minimalist icons for likes, comments, and shares to mirror current social media trends and reduce visual clutter.
- A clean, familiar layout mimicking popular social media platforms to reduce the learning curve for participants.
- Subtle animations on interactive elements (e.g., a momentary color change when a like button is pressed) to provide feedback without being distracting.
